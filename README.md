1. Decorator Pattern

         The decorator pattern dynamically modifies the behavior of a core object without changing
         its existing class definition.
         
2. FlyWeight Pattern

         Flyweight is about sharing. It holds a pool to store objects. 
         The client will reuse existing objects in the pool.

3. Builder Pattern

         The intent of the Builder design pattern is to separate the construction of a complex object 
         from its representation.

4. Prototype Pattern

         The prototype design pattern is used to create clones of a base object

5. Command Pattern

         Command pattern is a very simple pattern that allows you to decouple a class that 
         invokes a command from a class that knows how to perform it.

1. Decorator Pattern

         The decorator pattern dynamically modifies the behavior of a core object without changing
         its existing class definition.
         
2. FlyWeight Pattern

             Flyweight is about sharing. It holds a pool to store objects. 
             The client will reuse existing objects in the pool.
